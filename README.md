Suggestions:
✔️ CSS Styling
Instead of using a CSS library like Bootstrap, consider one of the following suggestions:
- Explore the concept of CSS-in-JS, which abstracts CSS to the component level, using JavaScript to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. Some popular libraries include styled-components and Emotion.
- Try using a component library, such as Semantic UI, Chakra UI, or Ant Design.
- Create all the CSS for your application just using CSS.

Payment Platform
- Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform. Even if you don’t create an e-commerce application, you could set up your site to accept charitable donations.

Bonus
Although this is not a requirement for your project, try to also implement functionality to meet the minimum requirements of a PWA:
- Uses a web manifest.
- Uses a service worker for offline functionality.
- Is installable.
